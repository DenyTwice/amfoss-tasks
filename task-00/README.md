I followed this [website](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/) to install ubuntu. I did neglect step one (backing up data) because I am using a relatively new laptop that doesn't have any data worth keeping a backup of. I had to borrow a pendrive from a friend to create the live linux usb using Rufus. I did get a bit confused with allocating memory to ubuntu but I eventually figured out that approach two was the way to go. 

Everything afterwards was simple. The only other configuration I had to do was to set linux to read RTC as local time so it didn't mess up my clock.
