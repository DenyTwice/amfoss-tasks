#Why must we choose you?
-------
I believe I would make a good addition to the team because of my love for problem solving and consequently, programming. I don't know if it's a natural trait or if I've somehow developed it over time but there is nothing that gets me going more than solving or "beating" a seemingly impossible problem. I may not be the best, but I'm trying to be better than yesterday, everyday. Along with my interest in basically anything to do with tech, I thtink I will be able to fit into the club quite well.

I like to think I'm pretty good at managing my time, so finding time to consistently work with amFOSS should be easy. Finally, I've always loved to learn, whether it's programming, science or anything in between, and I think that's a good trait for a student.

#What is your plan for the next 6 months?
-------
I do intend to do well academically but I aim to improve my personality as well. I doubt I'll be able completely decide where and what I wish to pursue in the next six months as I think I'll still have more to learn & explore by then but hopefully I'll have a clearer picture of my future at the very least. I want to delve much deeper into the world of programming and I believe amFOSS would help me find guides as well as companions for this journey.

#How would you contribute back to the club?
-------
I hope to further the legacy of the club. Whether that's by helping to conduct events or creating innovative project. I'm quite confident that I'll be ready to do whatever is required of me, and go beyond as well. 

#Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
-------
Not really. I would have liked to have a bit more info on the important dates, like when the process would start & end, a bit sooner. But that's about it.
